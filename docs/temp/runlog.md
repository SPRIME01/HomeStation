Anlayze this project to understand how its environment variables and secrets are configured and used. Then devise a robust strategy for better leveraging direnv (.envrc) to make the project more secure, easier to work with, improve the developer experience and quality of life. Make sure you suggestions adhere to best practices and do not incur technical debt


Here’s how env vars and secrets are configured today, plus a concrete, low‑debt plan to leverage direnv for stronger security and a smoother DX.

What I Found

Justfile: Uses env_var_or_default extensively for non-secret config (e.g., DOMAIN, HELM_*, NAMESPACE_*, PROMTAIL_ENABLED, etc.). These can be overridden by exported env vars.
Secrets: Centralized in Vault. The External Secrets Operator (ESO) reads Vault KV (kv/data/apps/...) and materializes Kubernetes Secrets. Example: deploy/flagsmith/deploy.yaml wires DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY from ESO-backed K8s Secrets.
Vault session: tools/scripts/vault_init.sh can export VAULT_ADDR/VAULT_TOKEN to tools/secrets/.envrc.vault (chmod 600). .envrc sources that file.
Cloudflare DNS-01: CF_API_TOKEN loaded by .envrc from tools/secrets/.envrc.cloudflare and used by just cf-dns-secret.
Gaps/Risks:
deploy/n8n/values.yaml hardcodes N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=CHANGEME. This should be moved to Vault + ESO to avoid plaintext in git.
No dotenv support for non-secret defaults; developers must export variables manually or depend on shell profiles.
No reload/watch hints in .envrc; changes may require reloading direnv manually.
What I Changed

Improved .envrc to be explicit, minimal, and reload-aware.
Adds watch_file on .env, .env.local, and secret stubs under tools/secrets/.
Loads .env then .env.local via dotenv_if_exists for non-secret overrides.
Continues to source tools/secrets/.envrc.vault (and legacy .env.vault) and optional tools/secrets/.envrc.cloudflare.
Optional lightweight Vault token health hint (toggle with DIRENV_SKIP_VAULT_CHECK=1).
Added tools/secrets/.envrc.cloudflare.example with a safe pattern for CF_API_TOKEN.
Added docs: docs/diataxis/guide-direnv.md and linked it from docs/diataxis/index.md.
Files touched

.envrc
tools/secrets/.envrc.cloudflare.example
docs/diataxis/guide-direnv.md
docs/diataxis/index.md
Recommended Strategy (Low-Overhead, Durable)

Division of responsibility:
Non-secrets: .env (committed) for defaults; .env.local (gitignored) for per-dev overrides.
Secrets: Vault + ESO for runtime; .envrc only loads a Vault session token and optional Cloudflare token.
Direnv usage:
Keep .envrc tiny and composable. Use source_env_if_exists for secret session files; dotenv_if_exists for non-secrets.
Use watch_file so changes auto-apply when you cd back into the project.
Avoid heavy logic in .envrc to keep shell entry fast. Any validations should be optional hints.
Justfile interoperability:
The env vars loaded by .env/.env.local feed directly into env_var_or_default without editing the Justfile. This keeps dev overrides easy and contained.
Git hygiene:
Keep .env free of secrets. Only place safe defaults (domains, flags).
Ensure tools/secrets/.envrc.vault, tools/secrets/.envrc.cloudflare, and .env.local remain ignored (already covered in .gitignore).
Close gaps:
n8n: Replace plaintext N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD with an ESO entry (e.g., ExternalSecret for n8n-app and read N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD via valueFrom.secretKeyRef). Want me to patch this for you?
Optional guardrails:
Add a lightweight pre-commit secret scanner (e.g., detect-secrets) if desired. Not required, but a nice safety net.
How To Use It (Developer Flow)

Install direnv and hook your shell once, then run direnv allow . in the repo.
Set non-secret defaults in .env; personal overrides in .env.local.
Run just vault-init to export a Vault session and optionally write tools/secrets/.envrc.vault. .envrc will load it automatically.
For public ACME via Cloudflare, copy tools/secrets/.envrc.cloudflare.example to tools/secrets/.envrc.cloudflare, fill CF_API_TOKEN, and run just cf-dns-secret.
Why This Avoids Tech Debt

Standardized, minimal .envrc with direnv stdlib only; no custom loader scripts to maintain.
Secrets remain in Vault → ESO → K8s. .envrc never becomes a secrets dumping ground.
Explicit file boundaries and watchers eliminate “works on my machine” drift without complex tooling.
Interlocks neatly with Justfile defaults and existing scripts.
If you want, I can:

Convert n8n to use ESO instead of hardcoded password.
Add a brief section to docs/diataxis/reference-env-vars.md mentioning .env/.env.local precedence and examples.

Convert n8n to use ESO instead of hardcoded password. And add a brief section to docs/diataxis/reference-env-vars.md mentioning .env/.env.local precedence and examples. Also update .github/copilot-instructions.md such that the environment vaiable and secrets are managed correctly


Here’s what I changed and how to use it.

n8n Secrets via ESO

Removed hardcoded password: deploy/n8n/values.yaml:20 removes N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD.
Load from Vault: deploy/n8n/externalsecret.yaml:1 creates n8n-env from kv/data/apps/n8n/app (property N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD).
Wire secret to Helm:
Bitnami chart: deploy/n8n/values.yaml:33 sets extraEnvVarsSecret: n8n-env.
Community chart: add deploy/n8n/community-values.yaml with an equivalent setting if you need custom env. I noted this in the Copilot guide.
Apply on deploy: tools/scripts/deploy_core.sh:119 now applies deploy/n8n/externalsecret.yaml when ESO CRD is present.
Docs and Guidance

direnv usage: docs/diataxis/guide-direnv.md:1 explains the setup, precedence, and safe patterns (Vault session + Cloudflare token; .env/.env.local).
Env precedence: docs/diataxis/reference-env-vars.md:12 now documents .env then .env.local (both gitignored) with .env.example as the committed template.
Committed example: .env.example:1 added with non-secret defaults.
Copilot instructions updated: .github/copilot-instructions.md:46 and :78 now reference tools/secrets/.envrc.vault and direnv; :128 documents n8n’s ESO wiring and community-chart note; a new section “Environment and secrets management” explains .envrc loading order, .env/.env.local usage, and not committing secrets.
Why this is better

Secrets never live in git. ESO pulls from Vault, and Helm consumes a K8s Secret.
direnv boosts DX: walk into the repo and your session (Vault token, non-secrets) is ready.
Clear precedence with .env/.env.local (untracked) and .env.example for guidance avoids drift and tech debt.
What you may want next

Do you want me to add deploy/n8n/community-values.yaml to wire n8n-env for the community chart explicitly?
I can also scan other charts for hardcoded secrets and move them to Vault + ESO similarly.

add deploy/n8n/community-values.yaml to wire n8n-env for the community chart explicitly.
Also scan other charts for hardcoded secrets and move them to Vault + ESO similarly.


Done. I wired n8n’s community chart to consume the secret from ESO and removed remaining hardcoded secrets (RabbitMQ) by switching them to ESO as well, plus updated docs/guides.

n8n (Community Chart)

Added values for community chart:
deploy/n8n/community-values.yaml:1
Sets envFrom: secretRef: n8n-env and keeps non-secret basic-auth env.
Already in place:
ESO secret producer: deploy/n8n/externalsecret.yaml:1
Bitnami wiring: deploy/n8n/values.yaml:33 uses extraEnvVarsSecret: n8n-env
Deploy flow:
Justfile already passes deploy/n8n/community-values.yaml when using community chart and N8N_USE_COMMUNITY_VALUES=1 (default) and the repo is present.
RabbitMQ (Removed hardcoded secrets)

Switched to ESO + existing Secret references:
deploy/rabbitmq/externalsecret.yaml:1 creates rabbitmq-auth with rabbitmq-password and rabbitmq-erlang-cookie from kv/data/apps/rabbitmq/app.
deploy/rabbitmq/values.yaml:1 replaces password/erlangCookie with:
auth.existingPasswordSecret: rabbitmq-auth
auth.existingErlangSecret: rabbitmq-auth
Apply ordering:
tools/scripts/deploy_core.sh:16 applies deploy/rabbitmq/externalsecret.yaml before the RabbitMQ Helm install if ESO is present.
Copilot Guide Updates

Path and usage corrections for direnv/Vault file:
.github/copilot-instructions.md:64 switched to tools/secrets/.envrc.vault
Added explicit chart wiring notes:
n8n: .github/copilot-instructions.md:132
RabbitMQ: .github/copilot-instructions.md:133
Project layout reflects the new files:
.github/copilot-instructions.md:115
direnv / Env Precedence Docs

Added .env.example to guide non-secret defaults:
.env.example:1
Clarified precedence and usage:
docs/diataxis/reference-env-vars.md:12
docs/diataxis/guide-direnv.md:14
Notes

Vault KV expectations:
n8n: kv/apps/n8n/app property N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD
RabbitMQ: kv/apps/rabbitmq/app properties password and erlangCookie
Flagsmith already uses ESO for SECRET_KEY and DATABASE_URL; no changes needed.
Want me to:

Seed Vault with the required KV paths (one-time helper script or just recipe)?
Add a short doc snippet under docs/diataxis/howto-observability.md or a secrets reference noting these Vault keys for quick onboarding?

Implemented a clean, best-practice path for secrets and quicker onboarding.

New: Vault Seeding Helper

Script: tools/scripts/vault_seed_kv.sh

Seeds Vault KV v2 with required keys:
kv/apps/n8n/app: N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD
kv/apps/rabbitmq/app: password, erlangCookie
kv/apps/flagsmith/app: secret-key
kv/apps/flagsmith/database: url (prompted; optional)
Flags:
--dry-run/-n: preview without writing
--non-interactive: skip prompts (only writes when possible)
--random: generate strong random values for applicable fields
--only n8n,rabbitmq,flagsmith: seed selected services
Validates vault CLI and VAULT_ADDR/VAULT_TOKEN; does not echo secrets.
Just recipe: vault-seed-kv

just vault-seed-kv (interactive)
just vault-seed-kv --random (autogenerate strong values)
just vault-seed-kv --dry-run (preview)
Files

tools/scripts/vault_seed_kv.sh
Justfile: adds vault-seed-kv
n8n Community Chart Wiring

Added: deploy/n8n/community-values.yaml
Uses envFrom: secretRef: n8n-env to consume ESO-produced secret.
Removed Remaining Hardcoded Secrets

RabbitMQ:
deploy/rabbitmq/externalsecret.yaml: ESO creates rabbitmq-auth with password and erlangCookie.
deploy/rabbitmq/values.yaml: uses auth.existingPasswordSecret and auth.existingErlangSecret.
tools/scripts/deploy_core.sh: applies RabbitMQ ExternalSecret before Helm install when ESO CRD exists.
Docs & Guidance

Observability how-to: docs/diataxis/howto-observability.md
Added “Secrets quickstart (Vault + ESO)” with commands and Vault paths.
Copilot guide: .github/copilot-instructions.md
Added “Seed app secrets in Vault (quickstart)” with just vault-seed-kv usage and seeded paths.
Clarified direnv/Vault session file name and loading.
Documented chart-specific secret wiring for n8n and RabbitMQ.
direnv docs and examples already in place:
.env.example for safe, non-secret defaults
docs/diataxis/guide-direnv.md and docs/diataxis/reference-env-vars.md cover precedence and workflow
How to use

just vault-init and allow .envrc to load tools/secrets/.envrc.vault.
Run just vault-seed-kv (or --random) to populate secrets.
Deploy as usual: just deploy-core, just deploy-obs, etc. ESO will sync secrets to K8s automatically.
Want me to add a small just recipe to seed only one service (e.g., just vault-seed-kv --only n8n --random) to the docs index, or leave it as-is?

yes but i would like for it to seed-kv for only the service I choose or for when i add a new service


Great idea. I added targeted seeding for specific services and a simple path for newly generated services.

What’s new

Seed only one built-in service
Use the existing seeding script with selection:
just vault-seed-kv --only n8n
just vault-seed-kv --only rabbitmq
just vault-seed-kv --only flagsmith
Random values:
just vault-seed-kv --only n8n --random
Seed a newly generated service (Nx)
New Just recipe:
just vault-seed <service>
just vault-seed <service> --random
Seeds kv/apps/<service>/APP_SECRET expected by the Nx generator’s ExternalSecret.
Under the hood

tools/scripts/vault_seed_kv.sh
Supports --only svc1,svc2 for built-ins (n8n, rabbitmq, flagsmith).
New: --seed-app-secret <name> to write kv/apps/<name>/APP_SECRET.
Justfile
vault-seed-kv: existing, unchanged usage for groups and --only.
New vault-seed <service> wrapper:
Calls the script with --seed-app-secret "<service>" and passes --random if provided.
Docs updated

.github/copilot-instructions.md
Shows both flows: built-ins via vault-seed-kv (--only/--random) and new services via vault-seed <name>.
docs/diataxis/howto-observability.md
“Secrets quickstart” now includes commands for single-service seeding and Nx services.
Quick examples

n8n only, random:
just vault-seed-kv --only n8n --random
RabbitMQ only, prompt:
just vault-seed-kv --only rabbitmq
New service my-api:
just vault-seed my-api --random
Want me to add a tiny “post-generate tip” to the Nx generator output that reminds you to run just vault-seed <name>?

Added the post-generate tip to the Nx service generator.

Change

tools/plugins/@org/nx-homelab-plugin/src/generators/service/generator.ts: after scaffolding, it now prints:
Generated service '<name>' in <path>
Next steps:
Seed Vault secret: just vault-seed <name> --random
Note: ESO path kv/apps/<name>/APP_SECRET with key APP_SECRET
Apply k8s manifests
This ties the generator’s ExternalSecret convention to the new Just recipes for quick, consistent onboarding.

OK, now how to get this homelab up and running and fully initialized such that i can access and use the services and it is fully deployed. I know we have the containers up, but as far as know that's it. Do you understand what i mean?


Yes, I understand — you want a short, practical runbook to take the scaffold from “charts applied” to “fully initialized, secrets seeded, TLS/DNS working, and UIs reachable.”

Below is a concise, end‑to‑end path you can run now.

Prereqs

kubectl + helm + docker/container runtime; node ≥ 18 + pnpm; vault CLI.
A working K8s cluster (k3s/Rancher Desktop/etc.) and current kube context set.
Optional: direnv for a smoother experience.
Workspace Setup

Clone/open the repo, then:
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env and adjust non-secrets as needed.
direnv allow . to auto-load .envrc and optional secrets (when created).
1) Configure MetalLB pool

just configure-network to safely pick a pool for your LAN.
This prevents IP conflicts and configures the pool for LoadBalancer services.
2) Install foundation (namespaces, CRDs, core infra)

Flannel users (default path): export SKIP_CILIUM=true
Install: just install-foundation
This installs MetalLB, Vault, External Secrets Operator, Argo CD, and base namespaces.
3) Initialize + unseal Vault, export a session

just vault-init
Choose to write tools/secrets/.envrc.vault (mode 600).
.envrc auto-loads it after direnv allow ..
If you didn’t write the file: source tools/secrets/.envrc.vault
4) Seed required secrets in Vault (one‑time)

All built-ins: just vault-seed-kv (guided) or just vault-seed-kv --random
Seed one service: just vault-seed-kv --only n8n (or rabbitmq, flagsmith)
New Nx service APP_SECRET: just vault-seed <service> --random
Vault paths seeded:
kv/apps/n8n/app: N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD
kv/apps/rabbitmq/app: password, erlangCookie
kv/apps/flagsmith/app: secret-key
kv/apps/flagsmith/database: url (optional; set if you have a DB)
kv/apps/<service>/APP_SECRET: APP_SECRET (Nx generator)
5) Bootstrap SSO + Vault K8s auth (ESO role)

just sso-bootstrap
This configures Vault’s Kubernetes auth and ESO role “eso”, and registers Ory Hydra clients.
6) Deploy core, observability, UX

Core: just deploy-core
RabbitMQ, n8n, Flagsmith. ESO ExternalSecrets are applied when CRD exists.
Observability: just deploy-obs
OTel Collector, Loki, Tempo, Mimir, Grafana.
Only enable Promtail after raising node ulimit:
Check: just promtail-check
When safe: PROMTAIL_ENABLED=1 just deploy-obs
UX: just deploy-ux
Homepage, Guacamole, Vaultwarden, MCP Context Forge.
7) TLS and DNS options

Local wildcard via cert-manager (default):
Trust local CA on your machine:
kubectl -n cert-manager get secret homelab-ca -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > homelab-ca.crt
Import homelab-ca.crt into OS/browser trust store.
DNS for <app>.homelab.lan:
Point your resolver to the MetalLB IP assigned to Traefik, or add /etc/hosts entries mapping <app>.homelab.lan → your MetalLB address.
Optional public TLS via Cloudflare:
Put export CF_API_TOKEN=... into tools/secrets/.envrc.cloudflare and direnv allow .
export TLS_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=yourdomain.tld
export ACME_EMAIL=you@example.com
just cf-dns-secret
just install-foundation (applies public issuers/wildcard)
Public ingress samples are provided (e.g., n8n/flagsmith/rabbitmq).
8) Verify

ESO sync: kubectl -n core get externalsecret,secret | grep -E 'n8n|rabbitmq|flagsmith'
Ingress: kubectl -n core get ingress
UIs (default domain homelab.lan):
Grafana: https://grafana.homelab.lan (admin/admin initially; change after login)
n8n: https://n8n.homelab.lan (Basic Auth user admin, password from Vault seed)
RabbitMQ: https://rabbitmq.homelab.lan (user user, password from Vault seed)
Flagsmith: https://flagsmith.homelab.lan
Health checks:
just doctor for environment and cluster readiness.
kubectl -n core get pods, kubectl -n observability get pods report ready states.
Common Pitfalls

ESO resources Pending: ensure VAULT_TOKEN valid, just sso-bootstrap ran, and ClusterSecretStore vault-kv exists.
TLS warnings: import the local CA (homelab-ca.crt) as above, or use Cloudflare/public TLS.
n8n password not accepted: confirm n8n-env Secret exists and chart is consuming it:
Bitnami: extraEnvVarsSecret: n8n-env in deploy/n8n/values.yaml
Community: envFrom.secretRef: n8n-env in deploy/n8n/community-values.yaml
If you want, I can:

Check your current cluster IPs and generate /etc/hosts entries for the key UIs.
Configure the Cloudflare public path end-to-end (tunnel or DNS-01) based on your domain.
yes please do and when you need me to do something or provide information please request it


I added a structured runbook and prepared to generate precise hosts entries. Two quick asks so I can finalize DNS/TLS and host mappings:

What DOMAIN do you want to use? Default is homelab.lan.
Do you want local-only TLS (trusted local CA) or public TLS via Cloudflare DNS-01? If Cloudflare, please confirm TLS_PUBLIC_DOMAIN and that you can set CF_API_TOKEN.
Please run this and share the EXTERNAL-IP:
kubectl -n kube-system get svc traefik -o wide
What I did

Runbook: docs/runbook.md now provides an end-to-end, step-by-step path from setup to reachable UIs, including seeding secrets, SSO bootstrap, deploys, TLS options, verification, and hosts entries workflow.
Next, once you share DOMAIN and the Traefik EXTERNAL-IP, I’ll:

Generate exact /etc/hosts lines for your chosen domain.
If you opt for Cloudflare, I’ll outline the minimal commands with your domain and note where to put CF_API_TOKEN.

Local-only TLS (trusted local CA). I’ll expose selected apps via Cloudflare Tunnel; skip DNS-01 on the cluster for now.
❯ kubectl -n kube-system get svc traefik -o wide

/TCP,443
/TCP 10d app.kubernetes.io/instance=traefik-kube-system,app.kubernetes.io/name=traefik


Perfect — local-only TLS with the bundled CA, and exposing select apps via Cloudflare Tunnel. I’ll assume DOMAIN=homelab.lan. If you want a different domain, tell me and I’ll regenerate the hosts entries.

Export CA:
kubectl -n cert-manager get secret homelab-ca -o jsonpath='{.data.ca.crt}' | base64 -d > homelab-ca.crt
Import:
macOS: open Keychain Access → System → Certificates → import homelab-ca.crt → set Always Trust.
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo cp homelab-ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/homelab-ca.crt && sudo update-ca-certificates
Fedora: sudo cp homelab-ca.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ && sudo update-ca-trust
Windows: certmgr.msc → Trusted Root Certification Authorities → Certificates → All Tasks → Import.

## Cloudflare Tunnel (no DNS-01 on cluster)

- Prereqs: Named Tunnel created in Cloudflare Zero Trust, you have its credentials.json and Tunnel UUID.
- Create/patch the K8s secret from credentials:
- just cloudflare-tunnel-secret /absolute/path/to/credentials.json
- Set the Tunnel UUID in config:
- just cloudflare-set-tunnel-id TUNNEL_UUID
- Review hostnames in deploy/cloudflared/config.yaml and add the public hostnames you want. Each route points at traefik.kube-system.svc.cluster.local:80 so Traefik serves your in-cluster apps.
- Apply the tunnel:
- just cloudflare-tunnel

If you want, tell me the public hostnames you’d like (e.g., n8n.yourdomain.com, rabbitmq.yourdomain.com), and I’ll patch deploy/cloudflared/config.yaml accordingly.

Quick Verify

- ESO/Secrets: kubectl -n core get externalsecret,secret | grep -E 'n8n|rabbitmq|flagsmith'
- Ingress: kubectl -n core get ingress
- Pods: kubectl -n core get pods; kubectl -n observability get pods
- UIs:
- https://grafana.homelab.lan
- https://n8n.homelab.lan (Basic Auth: user admin; password from Vault seed)
- https://rabbitmq.homelab.lan (user user; password from Vault seed)
- https://flagsmith.homelab.lan

## Want me to:

Patch deploy/cloudflared/config.yaml with your preferred public hostnames?
